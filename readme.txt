== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin affect the loading time? =
When you click the `Save` button the codes will be cached in files and there is no database queries at all :).

= Does the plugin modify the code I write in the editor? =
No, the code is printed exactly as in the editor. It is not modified/checked/validated in any way. You take the full responsability for what is written in there.

= Huvuru doesn't show on the website =
Try one of the following:
1. If you are using any caching plugin (like "W3 Total Cache" or "WP Fastest Cache"), then don't forget to delete the cache before seing the code printed on the website.
2. Make sure the code is in **Published** state (not **Draft** or **in Trash**).

= Does it work with a Multisite Network? =
Yes.

= What if I change the theme? =
The plugin is independent of the theme and they will persist through a theme change. This is particularly useful.
